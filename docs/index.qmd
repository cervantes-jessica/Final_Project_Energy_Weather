# Energy & Weather Analysis Package

*Eric Coons and Jessica Cervantes \| December 17, 2025*

## Project Overview

This package analyzes how weather patterns influence wholesale electricity prices in U.S. price hubs. The analysis covers:

-   Electricity data from EIA (2025)
-   Weather data from NOAA (2025)
-   Focus on Phoenix and Indianapolis price hubs as examples

## Goals and Steps 

1.  Clean and merge datasets
2.  Explore relationships between weather variables (temperature, wind, precipitation) and electricity prices
3.  Provide a simple predictive model using regression
4.  Deploy results in a Streamlit app


## Package Tutorial (Following the Goals and Steps)

### Acquire datasets

Download the wholesale electricity market data for 2025 from the [EIA website](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/wholesale/). If you want to follow our analysis exactly, the ice_electric-2025 dataset included in the package is the market data for 2025, and is what we will be using for this analysis.

Decide what cities/hubs you want to analyze. If you want to follow our analysis exactly, use Indianapolis and Pheonix. We chose these locations because they are representative of two market hub locations from the EIA data. Phoenix represents a hub with a large share of solar power, and Indianapolis represents a hub with hardly any solar power, which is another reason why we selected them. If you want to do analysis on other cities, make sure that you are selecting cities close to market hubs, and that those market hubs are different! Use the map found in the EIA website linked above to see where market hubs are located. 

Download the Phoenix and Indianapolis weather data from an appropriate weather station in the [NCEI Past Weather database](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/past-weather/) if you are following our analysis. An appropriate station will have precipitation data included. If you previously selected different cities to the ones we selected, download historic weather data from an appropriate station in those cities.

### Clean and Merge datasets

In order to complete our analysis, it is important to have all the relevant data in a single, clean .csv file. The code to do this is found in the revised_cleandata.py file. We also make use of the clean_weather() function to clean the weather datasets. The documentation for this function is at the bottom of this page. If you are doing this analysis with cities you selected yourself, make sure to use the corresponding market hub name + Peak as the hub_name arguments when running the clean_weather() function to create the dataframes. Concatenate all the weather data into one dataset.

Next, run the code to clean the electricity dataset, removing unnecessary columns and renaming columns to be more concise. If you are doing analysis on Indianapolis and Phoenix, leave 'Indiana Hub RT Peak' and 'Palo Verde Peak' as valid_hubs when running the filtering of the data. Otherwise, replace these with the names of the hubs corresponding to the locations you chose, then run the filter.

Once you have done this, run the code to merge the two datasets together. This code does not require any changing whether or not you selected different cities than we did. Now the data is in a clean and easily-analyzable format.

## Analyze the data



### Explore relationship between weather and electricity price

### Create simple predictive model using regression

## Deploy results to streamlit app

## Function Documentation

### clean_weather(df, hub_name)

The clean_weather function was created to take weather data from a single weather station as recorded in the NCEI database and make it usable for our analysis. It does this by:
- Removing leading/trailing characters, parentheses, making capitilization uniform in column names
- Removing all columns except for those necessary for analysis (Date and Precipitation)
- Changing the DATE column to be datetime rather than a string
- Filtering to only include weather data from 2025
- Adding a hub identifier to the dataframe, for easy merging with the electricity dataset
